# Implementation Status

Working context file. Updated at the end of every sprint.

## Decisions in force
- PRD v1.0 is the accepted baseline (header says Draft). See ADR-0001.
- Storage: native `b2sdk` behind a `StorageProvider` interface; new DMS bucket and key; 5-minute download URLs.
- Hosting and region: **Unknown / open**. Local dev only.
- Open: D2 (B2 bucket/region facts), D6 (Postgres RLS), D7 (malware scanner), D8 (job queue), D9 (email provider), D11 (revocation SLA), D12 (SSO account linking). See `DMS_IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE.md` section 11.

## Sprint 0: Repo scaffold (done, uncommitted)
**Changed:** monorepo skeleton: `services/api` (FastAPI health endpoint, settings), `packages/domain` (classification/state constants), CI workflow, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` (names only), ADR-0001. PRD and B2 audit copied to `docs/product` and `docs/audits`.

**Requirements touched:** STO-001 (default size constant), STO-008 (TTL bounds); no feature requirement completed.

**Tests executed (observed):**
| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `uv run ruff check .` (services/api) | All checks passed |
| `uv run pytest -q` (services/api) | 3 passed, 1 deprecation warning (starlette TestClient/httpx) |
| `npm run build` (packages/domain, `tsc --noEmit`) | Succeeded |
| `npm test` (packages/domain, vitest) | 3 passed |

**Not verified:** CI workflow has not run on GitHub; no database, no B2 contact.

**Known issues:** `npm install` reported audit advisories (not triaged); starlette deprecation warning suggests `httpx2` for the test client.

**Next recommended:** Sprint 1, database foundation (Postgres schema base, Alembic, tenant/user/membership tables, migration test). Requires a local PostgreSQL; confirm Docker or an installed instance.
